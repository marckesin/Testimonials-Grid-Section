        Daniel Clifford Verified Graduate I received a job offer mid-course, and
        the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&#39;s worth. “ I was an EMT
        for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&#39;ve been looking to
        make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
        experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
        best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
        I&#39;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
        at a VR startup. ” Jonathan Walters Verified Graduate The team was very
        supportive and kept me motivated “ I started as a total newbie with
        virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big
        company. This was one of the best investments I&#39;ve made in myself. ”
        Jeanette Harmon Verified Graduate An overall wonderful and rewarding
        experience “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I
        really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ”
        Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who
        did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
        from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned
        about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
        the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
        myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
        You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of smart and amazing people. ” Kira Whittle Verified Graduate
        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! “ Before joining
        the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
        step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
        staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
        wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
        tutorial could ever have. In fact, I&#39;ve often referred to it during
        interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
        offers. 100% recommend! ”
